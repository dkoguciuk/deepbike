DeepBike -- MLP for Bike Sharing Demand
===================

This is a simple approach to Bike Sharing Demand competition based on MLP architecture implemented in the Tensorflow framework. No rocket science, but still entertaining exercise. The Kaggle site about Bike Sharing demand you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).

----------

Set-up
-------------

There are some tools required to make this repo working:
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

You may also want to install vlc and vlc python bindings:

> $ sudo apt install vlc

> $ sudo pip install python-vlc

Usage
-------------

You can run network training with:
> $ ./train.py

The source code should be documented good enough to let you play with the hyperparameters etc. Have fun!
